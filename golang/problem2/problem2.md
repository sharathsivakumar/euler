# Notes Problem2

The aim to calculate the sum of even fibonnaci series terms

What is the fibonaaci serier?

The series starts with 1 and 2. The sum of the two terms is the next term while this is repeated.

## Algo

### Initialize
A1=1
A2=2
Sum=2
### Step1
A1 + A2 = A3
### Step2
if A3 is even, then add to Sum. 
### Step3
A1=A2
A2=A3

## Approach/Methods

### Conventonal looping
### Recursive fucntion
### Pointer manipulation
